## Master Branch
The `master `branch is a version of GalaxyAnvil intended for WorldAnvil to host as a selectable theme. This version includes CSS tags and code that is blocked or banned in custom CSS boxes and should not be copy+pasted into the custom CSS box of your world, else the theme will break. You can use GalaxyAnvil on WorldAnvil for free by selecting World Settings > Styling in the WorldAnvil Dashboard, and choosing 'GalaxyAnvil' in the Theme selection dropdown.

## Inline Branch
The `inline` branch is a version of GalaxyAnvil intended for power users to use in place of the selectable theme. To use this version, navigate to World Settings > Styling in the WorldAnvil Dashboard, select the CSS tab, then copy and paste the contents of `themes\galaxyanvil\css\style.css` into the Presentation Cascade Stylesheets (CSS) box. You can then modify the CSS as you see fit to match your world.

## Galaxies End Branch
The `galaxies-end` branch is the version of GalaxyAnvil inline specifically built for use in the Galaxies End WorldAnvil universe. This includes the custom color schemes used for different sections of Galaxies End, as well as additional personal tweaks added by SierraKomodo to better fit the Galaxies End universe that were deemed not fitting of GalaxyAnvil as a whole.
